## jdisplay
reusable react front end to display json blobs in a reactive spreadsheet format

This is a small react page that renders json, in later versions of this we will explore having controls for the application to show a variable amount of records from a live nosql db.

Success! Created jdisplay at /Users/james/code/react/opeventviewer/jdisplay/jdisplay
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd jdisplay
  yarn start

Happy hacking!
